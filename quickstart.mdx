# 📝 Introduction

Hello. My name is MaoMaoPrince and I’m addicted to Triple-Float Fishing Rods (TFRs). You should be too, they let you catch up to 4 fish and are best in slot for both Active & AFK fishing (no p2w).

The probabilities for catching more than one fish are below, in total you have a **48.8% chance to catch more than one fish.**

| **No. Fish** | **Probability** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 1            | 51.2%           |
| 2            | 38.4%           |
| 3            | 9.6%            |
| 4            | 0.8%            |

Much like with any addiction, there’s a catch. TFRs are non-repairable and limited in supply. The way to obtain them is locked behind a fishing quest that can take a while - especially if you don’t know what you’re doing.

Rather than hold your hand, the goal of this guide is to give you the knowledge, strategies, and tools to help speed up the process.  Enjoy!

# 🎣 Fish for Villagers – Beginner’s Guide (BDO)

Fish for Villagers is a repeatable quest with a 3-day cooldown, which rewards 3x [**Triple-Float Fishing Rod**](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/16153/). It requires you to catch 4 different types of fish (Tuna, Spotted Sea Bass, Black Porgy & Grunt) then hand them to specific villagers in Velia.

Except for Grunt, all the other fish can **only** be found in **Ocean Hotspots.** Finding them can be long and frustrating, so most of this guide will be focused that.

# 🌊 Introduction to Seagull Hotspots

Before anything else, you need to understand how Seagull Hotspots work and spawn.

### What is a Seagull Hotspot?

Seagull Hotspots are randomly spawning spots on the ocean that are marked by a group of seagulls feeding on a pool of fish. Each Seagull Hotspot allows you to catch one type of Rare Fish ONLY (e.g. a Grunt Hotspot contains only Grunt).

![Seagull Hotspot Animation](/images/seagull_hotspot.gif)

### Hotspot Properties

| Bite time - (~1 min)       | Lifetime - (~20-30 mins)             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Visible at - (e.g. Guru 2) | Catchable at - (e.g. Professional 7) |
| Min catches                | Max catches                          |

## Level Requirements

Hotspots have two fishing level requirements: “Visible at” the level require to **SEE** the Hotspots and “Catchable at” the level required to **CATCH** fish, even if you can’t see the Hotspot.

Typically, the further the Hotspot is from shore, the higher the fishing level required.

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  Fish with a high level Guru friend to be able to see ALL of the Hotspots.
</aside>

For this quest, the highest-level Hotspots are located northeast of Illya Island, so avoid that area if you're below Guru Fishing level.

To see _all_ the Hotspots in this guide, you need **Guru 17**. **DON’T DESPAIR!** Grunt can also be found outside of Hotspots, so you can choose to skip it — making the highest required level **Guru 7**.

| Fish Type        | Max ‘Visible At‘   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Tuna             | Guru 2             |
| Spotted Sea Bass | Guru 7             |
| Black Porgy      | Guru 7             |
| Grunt            | Guru 17 :big_eyes: |

## How do they spawn?

Each type of Hotspot has multiple fixed locations where they can spawn. These are not single points but square boundaries where that type of Hotspot may randomly spawn. (see images in next section).

All Hotspots within the same boundary have the same property values.

# 🗺️ Finding Hotspot Locations

Before anything else, **you need a boat.** Ideally, a super-fast one.

If you can’t get a super fast boat the [Epheria Cog](https://bdocodex.com/us/mount/31051/) is a great budget option. It’s regular fast, has [Breezy Sail](https://bdocodex.com/us/mountskill/38/) and is also my favourite. Sadly the Cog cannot be repaired - but it is [easy to craft.](https://grumpygreen.cricket/bdo-cog-ship/)

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  You can get the Cog for **1,000 Loyalty** in the pearl store.
</aside>

Next, you’ll need to know where the Hotspots are.  Generally speaking people use [bdolytics.com](https://bdolytics.com/en/EU/map) map when looking for specific Hotspot spawn locations. For this guide I’ve taken screenshots with each Quest Fish’s Hotspot boundaries, marking nearby landmarks.

## Quest Fish Hotspot Locations

![Tuna Hotspot Locations](/images/tuna_hotspots.png)

![Black Porgy Hotspot Locations](/images/black_porgy_hotspots.png)

![Grunt Hotspot Locations](/images/grunt_hotspots.png)

![Spotted Sea Bass Hotspot Locations](/images/spotted_sea_bass_hotspots.png)

## Where to pick?

With so much choice, RNG, and level gating, there’s no fool proof strategy. Instead, here are some considerations and a couple of general methods with tips & tricks.

First, I’ll cover how to pick a general area and a strategy/method. Then I’ll detail different tips & tricks you can use in the order you'll need them.

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  Remember to check [bdolytics.com](https://bdolytics.com/en/EU/map) for the level requirements. You can select your Fishing Level on the left to only show Hotspots you can see.
</aside>

## Method 1 - Boundary Overlap

So far you’ve only seen the boundaries for one fish at a time. Hotspot boundaries can overlap each other, forming some sort of cubist nightmare.

![All Fish Hotspots](/images/all_fish_hotspots.png)

All Fish Hotspots

![Only Quest Fish Hotspots](/images/quest_fish_hotspots.png)

Only Quest Fish Hotspots

Within the chaos you’ll see that West of Illya Island has an overlap of three Quest Fish, with more Hotspots within sailing distance. Since Grunt is easier to find elsewhere, this method focuses on optimising the other three fish. See the image below for suggested spot.

![Boundary Overlap Spot](/images/boundary_overlap_spot.png)

## Method 2 - Autopath Route

If you don’t want to think, you can follow an autopath route which covers most of the major spawn locations. This isn’t 100% optimal, but it is good for branding. :maomaochat:

![Autopath Route Example](/images/autopath_route.jpg)

<aside>
  <img src="/images/tip_icon.png" alt="Tip Icon" width="40px" />

  If your fishing level is low, try an autopath route around the Balenos Islands above Velia.
</aside>

# 🔍 Tips for finding and identifying Hotspots

Ok, you know what a Hotspot is. You have a map. You’ve chosen your strategy. Now you need to actually go look for them!

### Stop and look around

You need to actively scan for Hotspots — they can be hard to see at a distance, sometimes just a couple of pixels.

Make sure you are rotating the camera with your mouse, scanning the horizon. Occasionally stop to have a proper look.

<aside>
  <img src="/images/tip_icon.png" alt="Tip Icon" width="40px" />

  Sea foam will sometimes look like Hotspots at a distance.
</aside>

### Check behind islands

If a Hotspot spawns and you cannot see it, did it really spawn?

### Move default camera whilst sailing

By default, your boat is centred on screen. This can make it harder to see when the mast is up. I find it easier to move the camera to an “over the shoulder view”, this makes it easier for you to look for Hotspots as you sail.

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  To move the default camera position, press **`↑` , `↓` , `←` , `→` .**
</aside>

![Over the shoulder camera view](/images/over_the_shoulder_camera.jpg)

over the shoulder camera

## Advanced Tips

Assuming you still haven’t found one (it do be like that) you can try some slightly more advanced techniques.

### **Observe Mode**

Observe Mode lets you detach the camera allowing you to move, rotate and zoom. You can enter Observe Mode by using your **_ships crows nest_**, then press ‘R’.

Alternatively, you can also enter Observe Mode by sitting on the edge of your boat (put your back against any ledge then press `↓`**)** or use the **[Event] Sturdy Chair** item.

Let’s play _“Find the Hotspot Using Observe Mode.”_ (image below).

![Finding a hotspot using observe mode](/images/observe_mode_hotspot.png)

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  You can also use **Screenshot Mode** allowing you more precise control over the camera including filters and time of day/weather.
</aside>

### Time of day & weather

The time of day and weather have an impact on this quest, for both visibility and controlling your boat. Ideally, you’d do this quest on a lovely sunny day with clear skies, If it’s raining at night then it will be more difficult. That said, it’s not a massive difference most of the time.

### Switch Channel

Hotspot spawns are unique to each channel, meaning that you can sail to an area, look around, then switch channel  if you see nothing. Switching channels has a 5-minute cooldown.

<aside>
  <img src="/images/guild_tip_icon.png" alt="Guild Tip Icon" width="40px" />

  If you are in a guild you can **switch between the 3 home channels** with no cooldown.
</aside>

### Hotspotting on a Griffon

This started as a joke, but then it worked. Catch a ride on the griffon that travels between Velia and Illya. It takes about 4 minutes, stopping at each destination for 4 minutes.

You can then use this time to scout out Hotspot locations before you set sail, saving that sweet Epheria Cog durability.

![Spotting hotspots from a griffon](/images/griffon_hotspot_spotting.png)

<aside>
  ⚠️

  Be careful - falling off the logs will kill you. I’d rather not tell you how I know that.
</aside>

### Scope

Using a **Hunting Sniper Rifle** scope is surprisingly useful for spotting Hotspots and identifying fish.

<aside>
  🔑

  You can use a ***Hunting Sniper Rifle*** to zoom 1–3x, allowing you to identify fish from afar.
</aside>

| Sniper Rifle                                                         | Zoom | Level Requirement |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| [**Green & Blue Sniper Rifle**](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/66765/) | 1x   | -                 |
| [**Sniper Rifle**](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/56133/)              | 1x   | Apprentice 10     |
| [Marni Sniper Rifle](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/56519/)            | 3x   | Artisan 10        |

# 🐟 Identifying, Catching & Storing Fish

Once you find a Hotspot, you need to identify which type of fish is there. You can tell by looking at the 3D model of the fish jumping out of the water. Below are images of the different fish as seen underwater for visual clarity. Unfortunately, for some reason, Grunt and Tuna use the same model.(thanks to Crivens for the images)

**Black Porgy**

![Black Porgy model underwater](/images/black_porgy_model.png)

**Grunt**

![Grunt model underwater](/images/grunt_model.png)

**Tuna**

![Tuna model underwater](/images/tuna_model.png)

**Spotted Sea Bass**

![Spotted Sea Bass model underwater](/images/spotted_sea_bass_model.png)

The only thing left is to catch them. Equip last week’s TFR, feel the power surge through you, and catch all four fish in one cast. I believe.

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  Consider using 10 Energy (hold space) to further increase your chance to catch more fish.
</aside>

Now do that three more times. Congratulations - the next step is storing _them_ in your Fish Tank.

## Locking & Storing in Fish Tank

[Shim Cheong’s Miraculous Fish Tank (50 slots)](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/760687/) was buffed [May 22, 2025](https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-us/News/Detail?groupContentNo=8572&countryType=en-us/). Fish stored in the tank will now last longer - from **5 days to 10 days**. This is a huge indirect buff to _Fish for Villagers_, meaning you can store your fish longer and get **12x TFR** with minimal effort.

<aside>
  🔑

  By locking fish in your tank, you can catch **4 of each fish** on one trip. This means you only have to do the fishing portion **once** every **12 days.**

  Every **3 days** you can accept the quest and deliver the fish straight to the villagers.
</aside>

To lock a fish, first move it into your main inventory then press `Shift`+`Right-Click` to lock it. Finally Move it back to your Tank - (the fish will not show the lock icon whilst inside the tank)

<aside>
  <img src="/images/guild_tip_icon.png" alt="Guild Tip Icon" width="40px" />

  Locking your fish prevents you from accidentally selling them when using **‘Sell All’** at the Trade Manager.
</aside>

<aside>
  ⚠️

  There’s a bug that can unlock some of your fish. We believe it's caused when the game crashes or is force-closed via Task Manager.
</aside>

# 🎁 Villager Fish Delivery & Completing Quest

Now that you’ve caught all of the fish it’s time to head back to Velia to hand over the goods. Speak to each villager - there will be a dialogue option to deliver their fish.

Below is a route you can use to deliver to all the villagers efishiently. The second image is flipped, from the direction you will be facing after docking.

![Fish delivery route in Velia](/images/tfr_fish_delivery_route.png)

![Flipped fish delivery route in Velia](/images/tfr_flipped_delivery_route.png)

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  If the dialogue option for handing over the fish is greyed out, it’s likely because the fish is locked.
</aside>

After you have delivered the fish return to Abelin to complete the quest. However, you are not finished quite yet.  Abelin will offer a short follow-up quest **“Sweet Reward”** which gives you the **3x TFRs**.

<aside>
  ### [Sweet Reward](https://bdocodex.com/us/quest/1200/147/)

  **\[ Quest Start ] -** Abelin

  \[ **Objective ] -** Speak to Garnil at Velia Workshop
</aside>

<aside>
  <img src="/images/info_icon.png" alt="Info Icon" width="40px" />

  Use the *Find NPC* function to find Garnil — he’s nearby but inside a building up some stairs, so it's a bit awkward to show directly.
</aside>

That’s it!  you got the Trippies, im proud of you. Let the addiction begin.
