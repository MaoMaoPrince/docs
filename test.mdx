# üìù Introduction

Hello. My name is MaoMaoPrince and I‚Äôm addicted to Triple-Float Fishing Rods (TFRs). You should be too, they let you catch up to 4 fish and are best in slot for both Active & AFK fishing (no p2w).

The probabilities for catching more than one fish are below, in total you have a **48.8% chance to catch more than one fish.**

| **No. Fish** | **Probability** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 1            | 51.2%           |
| 2            | 38.4%           |
| 3            | 9.6%            |
| 4            | 0.8%            |

Much like with any addiction, there‚Äôs a catch. TFRs are non-repairable and limited in supply. The way to obtain them is locked behind a fishing quest that can take a while - especially if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing.

Rather than hold your hand, the goal of this guide is to give you the knowledge, strategies, and tools to help speed up the process.  Enjoy\!

# üé£ Fish for Villagers ‚Äì Beginner‚Äôs Guide (BDO)

Fish for Villagers is a repeatable quest with a 3-day cooldown, which rewards 3x [**Triple-Float Fishing Rod**](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/16153/). It requires you to catch 4 different types of fish (Tuna, Spotted Sea Bass, Black Porgy & Grunt) then hand them to specific villagers in Velia.

Except for Grunt, all the other fish can **only** be found in **Ocean Hotspots.** Finding them can be long and frustrating, so most of this guide will be focused that.

<Tip>
  ### Key Takeaways

  - Learn how to find Seagull Hotspots - the basics then more advanced tips
  - Learn how to identify and catch Fish
  - The [Fish Tank was buffed](https://www.notion.so/3-x-Triple-Float-Fishing-Rod-Quest-Fish-for-Villagers-1da3d23375b68042bd49d06535abbebf?pvs=21) so you only have to do the fishing once every 12 days
